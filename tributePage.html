       <b>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam</b>  was an Indian aerospace scientist and statesman who
        served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born on
        <strong>October 15, 1931</strong>in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and graduated from the
        Madras Institute of Technology.<br /><br />
        Kalam played a leading role in the development of India's missile and
        nuclear weapons programs.2 He made significant contributions as Project
        Director to develop India's first indigenous Satellite Launch Vehicle
        (SLV-III), which successfully injected the Rohini satellite in July 1980
        and made India an exclusive member of Space Club.3 Kalam was a central
        figure in the development of India's nuclear capabilities and was hailed
        as a national hero after a series of successful tests in 1998.1 He
        passed away on<strong>July 27, 2015</strong>, in Shillong. <br /><br />
        Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
        His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with
        numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim
        ethnic group found in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent
        from Arab traders and local women. The family business had involved
        trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from
        Sri Lanka, as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban.
        With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to the mainland in <strong>1914</strong>, however,
        the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by
        the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty
        stricken by the time Kalam was born. As a young boy he had to sell
        newspapers to add to the family's meager income.
        <br /><br />

        After graduating from the Madras Institute of Technology in<strong>1960</strong>,
        Kalam
        joined the Aeronautical Development Establishment of the Defence
        Research and Development Organisation (by Press Information Bureau,
        Government of India) as a scientist after becoming a member of the
        Defence Research & Development Service (DRDS). He started his career by
        designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of
        a job at DRDO.[26] Kalam joined the INCOSPAR, working under Vikram
        Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. He was interviewed and recruited
        into ISRO by H. G. S. Murthy, the first Director of Thumba Equatorial
        Rocket Launching Station (TERLS).[27] In 1969, Kalam was transferred to
        the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project
        director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which
        successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July
        1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project
        independently at DRDO in 1965.<strong>In 1969,</strong>Kalam received the
        government's approval and expanded the programme to include more
        engineers. <br><br> In 1963 to 1964, he visited NASA's Langley Research Center in
        Hampton, Virginia; Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland;
        and Wallops Flight Facility. Between the 1970s and 1990s, Kalam
        made an effort to develop the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and
        SLV-III projects, both of which proved to be successful. Kalam was
        invited by Raja Ramanna to witness the country's first nuclear test
        Smiling Buddha as the representative of TBRL, even though he had not
        participated in its development.<br><br> In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two
        projects, Project Devil and Project Valiant, which sought to develop
        ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV
        programme. Despite the disapproval of the Union Cabinet, Prime
        Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace
        projects through her discretionary powers under Kalam's
        directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union
        Cabinet to conceal the true nature of these classified aerospace
        projects. <br><br> His research and educational leadership brought him great
        laurels and prestige in the 1980s, which prompted the government to
        initiate an advanced missile programme under his directorship. Kalam
        and Dr V S Arunachalam, metallurgist and scientific adviser to the
        Defence Minister, worked on the suggestion by the then Defence Minister,
        R. Venkataraman on a proposal for simultaneous development of a quiver
        of missiles instead of taking planned missiles one after another. R
        Venkatraman was instrumental in getting the cabinet approval for
        allocating <strong>â‚¹ 3.88 billion</strong>for the mission, named Integrated Guided
        Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) and appointed Kalam as the chief
        executive. Kalam played a major part in developing many missiles
        under the mission including Agni, an intermediate range ballistic
        missile and Prithvi, the tactical surface-to-surface missile, although
        the projects have been criticised for mismanagement and cost and time
        overruns. <br><br> Kalam served as the Chief Scientific Adviser to the
        Prime Minister and Secretary of the Defence Research and Development
        Organisation from <strong>July 1992 to December 1999.</strong>The Pokhran-II nuclear
        tests were conducted during this period in which he played an intensive
        political and technological role. Kalam served as the Chief Project
        Coordinator, along with Rajagopala Chidambaram, during the testing
        phase. Media coverage of Kalam during this period made him the
        country's best known nuclear scientist. However, the director of the
        site test, K Santhanam, said that the thermonuclear bomb had been a
        "fizzle" and criticised Kalam for issuing an incorrect report. Both
        Kalam and Chidambaram dismissed the claims. <br><br> <strong>In 1998,</strong>along with
        cardiologist Soma Raju, Kalam developed a low cost coronary stent, named
        the "Kalam-Raju Stent".<strong>In 2012,</strong>the duo designed a rugged
        tablet computer for health care in rural areas, which was named the
        "Kalam-Raju Tablet.
